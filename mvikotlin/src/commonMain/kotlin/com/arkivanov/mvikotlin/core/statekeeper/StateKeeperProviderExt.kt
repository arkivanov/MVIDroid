/**
 * Provides a way to retain instances via [StateKeeper].
 * A typical use case is to retain instances on Android configuration change.
 *
 * The initial `instance` is created using the provided `factory` function that accepts a special [Lifecycle].
 * The special [Lifecycle] is same as the original one
 * but its [onDestroy][Lifecycle.onDestroy] method is not called when the `instance` is retained.
 * The `instance` is retained and restored together with its special [Lifecycle].
 * After restoration the special [Lifecycle]'s [onCreate][Lifecycle.onCreate] method is also not called,
 * since it was not destroyed. The special [Lifecycle]'s [onDestroy][Lifecycle.onDestroy] method is called
 * when the original [Lifecycle] is destroyed and the `instance` is not retained.
 *
 * @param lifecycle an original [Lifecycle] to be used
 * @param key a key that should be used for `instance` preservation, see [StateKeeperProvider.get] for more information
 * @param factory a factory function that accepts the special [Lifecycle] and returns an `instance` to be retained later
 * @return either a retained `instance` or a new `instance` created by the `factory` function if there is no retained one
